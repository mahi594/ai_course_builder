In this video, i will tell you what deep learning is, why popular is happening and how many years have you been deep learning? You guys have heard about ai that you have heard about data science, but many people have also been watching deep learning. What is going to happen? How is the career of the industry? In this video, we will talk about the depth of the world. So, deep learning is a subset of ai that is under the individual intelligence. When we talk about machine learning, and when we talk about deep learning, then fundamentally, there are little differences. I will tell you about it in their mind. When we talk about machine learning, then we talk about mathematical algorithms, which are data that the machine is using. How can the data get in the future of the data? For example, if you are a doctor, and a cat, if you are a algorithm, then you can tell that this is a dog or cat. So, you can apply a classification, you can do a regression, for example, house price prediction. If you have a lot of data in your house, like this, how many rooms, how many bathrooms, how many houses and size. And after that, you can get a new set of features. So, you can train this data, and the model of your model, which will tell you the new features, how many of them are priced. Deep learning is a difference. Deep learning is inspired by human brain. These neurons are processed in a new way. And in the nerve impulses, one cell is divided into two and three cells. Manlo, our brain is a very complex pattern. Whenever we talk about learning algorithm, we will assume that our data is represented in one function. As a function, we can get a function of features in which we feed features. For example, if you are a house price prediction, then you can get a function of features in one house. So, we have to prep function. We can get features in which we feed features. Deep learning is about target. We can get a function. And we can get a function of a function. We use series of layers. Every neuron is corresponding to a new value. One layer can be a neuron. And our path can be very light. So, we can build a new network in deep learning. Which we can facilitate all this. This neural network is built by building a network. And we can update our weights. As we update our weights, we can get actual idle function. Which we present on this data. And we can get a function of our target deep learning. We can get a function of this function. We can get a new network in our data. We can get our weights. And we can get our function accurately. We can get all weights. That we get a function of this function. Which we can get in the data as an input layer. And finally, we can get the labels out of the data. And we can get a lot of data in our data. Now, i want to ask you about this video. I want to discuss some of these videos in the background. But there is a high level idea. Now, let's talk about why this is popular in the day. This is a very poor technique. Why is this popular in the day? I will tell you that today's topic is good computer. One time, it was a very big, big load of good computers. And the good computers that were used today were the average in the age of the age of the age. So, the high computer that was used today was very expensive. When i compute cpu, ram and gpus, i am going to tell you that in today's video, gpus, cpus, cpus, i am going to be going to be going to be a technology. Let's see how it looks. The deep learning enthusiasm is very training. It is very easy to get insights. And it is running in our experiments. One time, it was not running in our experiments. Because it was hard to support that experiment. And today, we have to learn how to get into the game that any of you can start your back from your back. Now, this entire planet, i have told you a lot about high level. What is the difference between you and the average level? If you are able to make a variable, then you have to make a short quote. The answer is no, you have to be starting to get a short quote. Our boss is a very library zootian. In this, you guys get a pretty big question. For example, tensorflow, pytorch, cafes 1, microsoft's cognitive tool kit. And also, it is a default jazz. And our boss is a very library zootian. And they are going to use their list. And they are going to use their library as a popular library. So, in today's video, i have played a lot of games with neural networks. So, i will share with you all the libraries. You guys will start your journey starting your journey. If you are doing this in deep learning, you will be able to do this. Now, let's talk about how the average salary is. If i talk about india, then a entry level, deep learning engineer, india's anger comes from the bottom of the box. And i am talking about this fresher. I am talking about this salary chobhis lag. If we talk about non-tech giant companies, and when you are taking tech giant companies, some experience lake, then this salary is a crore per annum. I am talking about this personally, which is a deep learning job. One crore is also a big loss. So, that was all about deep learning. I hope you guys have enjoyed this video. You guys have enjoyed this video. Now, let's get this video back. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And i will see you next time.
